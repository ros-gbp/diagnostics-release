ros-melodic-self-test (1.7.0-1stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * catkinize the stack
  * use the proper gtest macro
  * Explicitely set selftest_rostest to be in the all target, to fix #3178 <https://github.com/ros/diagnostics/issues/3178>.
  * Moved failed test message to just after the test, rather than after all the tests in self_test.
  * Eliminated warnings from run_selftest, and made it set its return code based on whether the test passed or not.
  * Undeprecated run_selftest.
  * Added a check in self test for ROS having shut down. Allows a node that is self testing to exit faster on CTRL-C.
  * Unit test files
  * Adding unit tests for self_test
  * Removing deprecated set_status_vec from self_test package
  * Added Ubuntu platform tags to manifest
  * Added removeByName to the self_test example.
  * Added a warning if test passes but setID was not called.
  * Marked diagnostic_updater and self_test as doc reviewed.
  * Tweaked examples and documentation based on doc review feedback.
  * Tweaked package description.
  * Updated manifest documentation and authorship.
  * Added a ROS_INFO at the beginning of each test.
  * Doc review of self test, dox fixes
  * Removed a redundant message, and took out spurious newlines.
  * Added a message at the end of the self-test.
  * Took out all deprecated stuff from self_test
  * Updated review status to API cleared.
  * Fixed example program after rename of self_test::Sequencer
  * Set a timeout of zero to callAvailable in checkTest. Renamed Sequencer to TestRunner.
  * Updated links in main page.
  * Corrected typo in main page.
  * Added main page. Took out threading by putting the self_test service in a separate queue. Created the Sequencer class to replace the now deprecated Dispatcher class. Sequencer is non-templated and does not have an owner member.
  * Made changes related to Nov 1 2009 API review.
  * Replaced sleep with waitForService. Took out delay parameter, added in a max_delay parameter. Took gensrv out of the CMakeLists.txt.
  * Got rid of deprecated access to ~parameters.
  * Updated documentation. Made doTest private as it should be. This should not break anything unless somebody is doing something really strange.
  * Making self_test package build now that ros::Node is gone.
  * Added extra debugging options to self_test and diagnostic_updater. On by default for self_test, off for diagnostic_updater. When on, failing statuses will be printed to the console.
  * updated self_test, diagnostic_updater, dynamic_reconfigure and wge100_camera to use new ~ namespace access method
  * diagnostics 0.1 commit. Removed diagnostic_analyzer/generic_analyzer and integrated into diagnostic_aggregator.
  * Fixed a sneaky bug that had slipped in during the diagnostic conversion.
    (It would have been easy to catch if Warnings were more prominent.)
  * Fixes for diagnostic_msgs::KeyValue::label -> key
  * Fixed bug in declaration of deprecated class.
  * Deprecated old self_test and diagnostic_updater APIs.
  * Lengthened delay, and made it return a saner failure message if it times out waiting to start the test.
  * Changed nomenclature in driver_base. Renamed method names to use camelCase.
    Got forearm_node working with driver_base: now appears to be working well.
  * robot_msgs/Diagnostic*  to diagnostic_msgs/Diagnostic* and robot_srvs/SelfTest into diagnostic_msgs too
  * Added DiagnosedPublisher and HeaderlessDiagnosedPublisher to automatically
    publish diagnostics upon publication, and integrated them with the
    forearm_camera.
    Started writing an outling of the driver_base classes.
  * Added a selftest_rostest node that wraps a call the self-test
    service of a node for rostest.
  * Unhid the add method. Renamed the internal add so it does not cause
    conflicts.
  * Fixed a bug that was causing slow startup on some nodes.
  * Updated to match changes to diagnostic_updater
  * Upgraded self_test to use the NodeHandle API, and to allow more general
    callback functions.
